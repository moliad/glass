 tests folder
============

In this folder we put small test scripts which allow us to test various parts of 
glass while in debug and for regression changes.

Most of these scripts are very small layout tests with a select few controls.

This is probably the best source of knowledge on Glass, since it is used to both
develop, test, and document how to use the various parts of Glass.
