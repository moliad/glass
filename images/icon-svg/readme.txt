GLASS Icons
-----------

I've decided to share the source files which generate the icons used by the icon library.

Every new icon which will be added to the GLASS system will be put here as well.

If you create new icons, please share them back, I'll put them in the distribution with full attribution.

The only requirement being that they be released using MIT license.



MISSING SVGs
------------
Some bitmap icons are in the icon libs and don't have an associated SVG file here. These are copyright from their 
respective authorsand the license below doesn't apply.

these icons where taken from free icon sites on the web and will eventually be replaced with originals along with their SVGs.

All icons taken from the web had compatible license which permit use in free and commercial apps, royalty free.

If these icons belong to you, please tell me and I'll attribute them within this file.
